## About

A practice repository for learning and experimenting with Git and GitHub workflows taught in **SPROuT Day 3: SAVE**. This is a safe space to break things, make mistakes, and learn version control hands-on.

**Key Principle**: 🎉 **There are no wrong moves here!** This playground is designed for experimentation.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a:

- 🔧 **Testing ground** for Git commands before using them in real projects
- 🎓 **Practice space** for collaborative workflows (branches, PRs, merge conflicts)
- 🧪 **Experimentation zone** for trying new Git features safely
- 🤝 **Collaboration trainer** for working with teammates on GitHub

## What You Can Practice Here

### Basic Git Operations

- ✅ Clone repositories
- ✅ Make commits with meaningful messages
- ✅ View commit history
- ✅ Restore previous versions
- ✅ Add and track files
- ✅ Stage and unstage changes

### Branching & Merging

- 🌿 Create and switch between branches
- 🌿 Work on features in isolation
- 🌿 Merge branches together
- 🌿 Resolve merge conflicts (intentionally create some!)
- 🌿 Delete branches after merging

### GitHub Workflows

- 🔄 Push and pull changes
- 🔄 Fork repositories
- 🔄 Open pull requests
- 🔄 Review code changes
- 🔄 Comment on commits and PRs
- 🔄 Manage collaborators

### Advanced Operations

- 🚀 Use `.gitignore` files
- 🚀 Stash changes temporarily
- 🚀 Revert commits
- 🚀 Cherry-pick commits
- 🚀 Rebase branches (carefully!)

## Common Commands to Practice

### View Status & History

```bash
git status              # What's changed?
git log --oneline       # Commit history
git diff                # What exactly changed?
```

### Make Changes

```bash
git add <file>          # Stage changes
git commit -m "msg"     # Save snapshot
git push                # Upload to GitHub
```

### Branch Operations

```bash
git branch              # List branches
git branch <name>       # Create branch
git checkout <name>     # Switch branch
git merge <branch>      # Merge branch
```

### Sync with Remote

```bash
git fetch               # Download updates (don't merge)
git pull                # Download + merge updates
git push origin <branch> # Upload your branch
```

## Files You'll Find Here

This playground contains intentionally simple/silly files:

- R scripts (some working, some broken)
- Data files
- Text documents
- Various file types for practice

**Note**: Files might be messy, have typos, or not make sense - that's intentional! Focus on the Git operations, not the content.

## Tips for Learning

1. 💡 **Experiment fearlessly** - you can't break anything important
2. 📖 **Read error messages** - they're usually helpful
3. 🤝 **Practice with others** - collaboration is the point
4. 🔄 **Repeat operations** - muscle memory matters
5. 📝 **Keep notes** - document what works for you
6. ❓ **Ask questions** - post in the [SPROuT Forum](https://github.com/orgs/CUNI-SPROuT/discussions)
7. 🎯 **Start simple** - master basics before advanced features

## What NOT to Practice Here

- ❌ Don't push real research data
- ❌ Don't commit sensitive information (passwords, tokens)
- ❌ Don't use this for actual project work
- ❌ Don't force push to `main` branch (practice, yes; chaos, no)

## Getting Help

## Remember

> "The best way to learn Git is to use Git."
>
> "The second best way is to break Git, then fix it."

**This playground exists so you can do both safely!** 🚀
